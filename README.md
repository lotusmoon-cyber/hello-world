# hello-world
Just another repository 

Well to say I am human is a reflection of my design
Here on earth. 
I am home in my body to the earth
I see and hear in levels others do not 
So I began the salt journey to take me 
To each life check point 
The calming effects from the taste designed
For my tongue 
The medication not made for all to handle 
But designed for my fine dine. 
To heal to become to create the magic 
Of materializing the Medicine yo to smoke
When I need to without stress or pain
To heal my mind to make it to the next level
Here I am 27 and kind and right in my mind
The fine design of the Lotus living on the 
Mountain. 

Thank you judge only yourself for I am trye
